# AGENTS.md

## Scope
- These instructions apply to the entire repository until a nested `AGENTS.md` overrides them.
- Follow this file whenever you add or modify source, scripts, Docker assets, or skills anywhere in the repo.

## Repo Overview
- `Makefile` orchestrates the local containers (`build_opencode`, `run_opencode`, `run_ollama`, etc.) and is the preferred entry point for automation.
- `install.sh` appends an `oc` helper alias that shells out to `make -C <repo> run_opencode`; keep it POSIX-compliant because it is sourced in user shells.
- `anvil/` is the Docker build context shared by every harness image (OpenCode, Claude Code): Dockerfile, container entrypoint, and the unified-agent translator.
- `opencode/` holds the OpenCode-native repo config layer (`opencode.json`, plus untracked plugin state); harness-neutral assets live at the top level in `skills/`, `commands/`, and `agents/`.
- `ollama/` stores persistent Ollama state. Do not add large model blobs to git—only configuration or lightweight defaults belong here.

## Coding Conventions
- Default to Bash or POSIX shell for scripts and include `set -euo pipefail` (or equivalent) when modifying shell entrypoints.
- Prefer `make` variables and targets over ad-hoc scripts so contributors can compose workflows via the existing Makefile.
- Keep Dockerfiles Debian-based (see `DEBIAN_TAG`) and avoid pinning GPU driver versions inside the image; rely on host NVIDIA tooling instead.
- When editing skills under `skills/`, ensure YAML frontmatter only contains `name` and `description`, and keep the detailed guidance in the corresponding `SKILL.md` body.
- Subagent definitions under `agents/` use the unified agent format documented in `README.md` (`## Agents`); the entrypoint rewrites them per harness via `anvil/translate_agents.py`, so never hand-write harness-specific dialects there.

## Build, Test, and Run
- Build the OpenCode image with `make build_opencode` after changing anything under `anvil/`.
- Launch a development session via `make run_opencode PROFILE=<name> DATA_DIR=<path?>` (defaults are fine for local work). The target automatically mounts project files and skills.
- Run the skill test harness via `make test MODEL=<provider/model>`.
- Filter skill tests with `TEST_SKILL=<skill-name>` and adjust timeouts with `TEST_TIMEOUT_S=<seconds>`.
- Start the local Ollama service with `make run_ollama` when testing models; pair it with `make stop_ollama` and `make clean` to tear everything down.
- Use `gpu_stat` (wraps `nvidia-smi`) to confirm GPU availability before running high-memory models.

## Additional Notes
- Keep secrets, API keys, and downloaded models out of version control; anything mounted into containers should be reproducible from repo contents.
- If you add new tooling, document the invocation in `README.md` so contributors understand how it integrates with `make`.
- Prefer small, surgical edits—do not reformat or restructure unrelated files when touching scripts or skills.
